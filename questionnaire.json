9. Logging and Analytics
  - How do you want to handle application and web logs?
    - Use the _spartan recommended platforms (kibana and grafana). I understand that this may require some additional set up and configuration
    - Use local storage.
    - This is handled elsewhere in the technology stack (compensatingControl)
    - I do not want to deal with this right now (No logging or analytics). I understand that this may expose details of application failure states and configuration to untrusted parties.
  - What log levels do you want to have?
    {
      "trace" : "Only when I would be \"tracing\" the code and trying to find one part of a function specifically.",
      "info" : "Generally useful information to log (service start/stop, configuration assumptions, etc)",
      "warn" : "Anything that can potentially cause application oddities, but for which I am automatically recovering.",
      "debug" : "Information that is diagnostically helpful to people more than just developers (IT, sysadmins, etc.)",
      "error" : "Any error which is fatal to the operation, but not the service or application (can't open a required file, missing data, etc.). These errors will force user (administrator, or direct user) intervention",
      "fatal" : "Any error that is forcing a shutdown of the service or application to prevent data loss (or further data loss)",
      "verbose" : "show everything, regardless of log level"
